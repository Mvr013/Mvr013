Overview
========
Grid  modernization  is  inevitable  to  promote  a  paradigm shift from passive distribution to Active Distribution Systems(ADS) due to the ever-growing penetration of various renewable  energy  resources  at  the  distribution  system.  Moreover, these ADS are equipped with thousands of devices, including Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), transformers, capacitor banks, fuses, relays, and switches. To this end, Grid modernization offers a viable and cost-effective mechanism to install more  measurement  devices  to  monitor  and  remote  control through  communication  networks  of  various  devices  across ADS.  Further,  it  provides  enhanced  system  observability  as per the Department of Energy (DOE) [CIT1]_. Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is a central part of grid modernization intended to provide data-rich environment via two-way communication between customers and utilities. It includes coordination among  smart  meters,  information  and  communications technologies, and advanced data analytics at the control center.  Sensor malfunction and communication failure-based data anomalies in the data-rich environment potentially weaken the successful execution of Advanced Distributed Management System (ADMS) applications. Therefore, network operators make use of network-wide anomaly detection at the distribution feeder as a preprocessing stage before adopting ADMS applications [CIT1]_. 

This document explains anomaly detection and voltage forecasting applications developed by Washington State University (WSU).  The demonstration of its functionality follows this by integrating it with a standards-based open-source platform -- `GridAPPS-D <https://gridappsd.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`_, developed by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).
