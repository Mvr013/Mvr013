Definition of Terms
-------------------

Data Anomaly -  defined  as an  observation/measurement  of  an unusual pattern that does not satisfy the physics of the power flow  for  the  given  distribution  system (missing data and bad data).

Platform - Refers to GridAPPS-D platform.

Simulation - A real world distribution system currently done by GridLAB-D.

Simulator - In current release GridLAB-D serves as the simulator.

GridLAB-D - GridLAB-D is a distribution level powerflow simulator. It acts as the real world distribution system in GridAPPS-D.

Power System Model - A modified IEEE 8500 model is used and is referred as IEEE 9500-node model.
